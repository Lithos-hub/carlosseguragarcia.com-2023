          Music has been a part of my life since I was 9, but in 2020, I
          discovered my passion for web development. With a self-taught
          approach, I dove into online resources, video tutorials, and my own
          projects. Concurrently, I pursued my studies in DAW CFGS from October
          2020 to May 2022.

          I kickstarted my career in March 2021 as a frontend developer at a CGI
          company, where I led the development of the entire frontend of a
          banking application for nearly a year. My expertise in web development
          led me to Cathedral Software in June 2022, where I work as a frontend
          developer.{" "}
          <strong>
            Here, I continually learn new and cutting-edge technologies, best
            practices, and agile methodologies.

          Moreover, I explore other areas of development, such as backend
          technologies like Node and{" "}
          <strong>
            MongoDB, mobile technologies like Dart and Flutter and WebGL
            technologies like Three.js.

          I&apos;m always eager to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest
          trends and tools in the industry.
