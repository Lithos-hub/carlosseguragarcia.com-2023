# carlosseguragarcia.com - Version 4


This is the fourth version of my personal website. The first version was released in 2020. Here, you will learn a little bit about me and my work. You can also find my contact information and social links. 

This version was made using Next 13, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. It's a onepage website with 5 sections: Hero, About, Experience, Skills and Projects.

* In **about**, you will read a short bio of myself.

* In **experience**, you will find a history of my work experience.

* In **skills**, you will see a series of skills that I have acquired over the years.

* In the **projects** section you will find a list of my most recent and important projects. Some of my projects are still in development or in continuous improvement.
